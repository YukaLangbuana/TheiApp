<h2 style="font-weight: 800;">Setup</h2>
You have two options!

<h4 style="font-weight: 800;">1. React-Native</h4>
---
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/YukaLangbuana/TheiApp
$ cd TheiApp/
$ yarn install
$ react-native run-ios
```
Note: You may have to run `cd ios && pod install` if the build failed.

<h4 style="font-weight: 800;">2. XCode</h4>
We're using Cocoapods. So you would need to open the `.xcworkspace` project.
---
1. Open XCode
2. File --> Open...
3. Open the file `~/TheiApp/ios/TheiApp.xcworkspace`

Feel free to hack around with the setup. This is how I got it loaded on my local machine.
